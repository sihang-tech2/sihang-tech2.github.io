        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>MBTA Subway Crowding Dashboard is an online interactive dashboard that provides MBTA
subway crowding information. The dashboard allows users to discover a station's crowding
information at various times, on different days of the week, view the crowding simulation for
your subway car, as well as the crowd levels throughout a trip.</p>

<p>The data shown on the dashboard are crowding metrics calculated using MBTA ridership data
provided by KORBATO.</p>

<p>The project hopes to achieve the goal of providing riders with the useful crowding information
they need to better plan their trips.</p>
        <h1>Methods</h1>
        <p>
            This project took a different approach to design a public-facing dashboard. First of all, instead
            of an all-in-one view traditional dashboard, this project aims to minimize the cognitive loads of
            the reader, to have visualizations spread into multiple views. Limiting the display to one topic at
            a time helps prevent the reader from feeling swamped by excessive information.
        </p>

<p>
    Secondly, the dashboard has a partially author-driven narrative pattern, in which the viewer is
    guided browser through the whole site and accompanied by some explanatory texts. I believe,
    this will help the viewers better explore the dashboard by giving them enough instructions.
</p>

<p>
    Thirdly, when it come to designing a public-facing dashboard, we are thrilling to show useful
    information and insights to our audiences not just data. Therefore, we aggregated data,
    developed easily understandable metrics, and designed intuitive visualizations (including crowd
    simulations). by doing so, we aimed to create a dashboard that offers actionable insights and
    helps viewers make informed decisions.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, a public-facing dashboard should engage viewers with visually appealing visualizations,
    not just boring statistical charts. In line with this idea, our project has made an effort to design
    and develop engaging visualizations that draw viewers in and encourage them to explore the
    underlying data.
</p>

        <h1>Future Work</h1>
        <p>
            I have to acknowledge that this dashboard at this moment is not a full-stack website. Ideally, it
            should have the ability to automatically update every two weeks to reflect the most recent
            crowding situations on the MBTA subway system. In order to achieve this, the dashboard
            needs to be able to connect to an API and fetch the latest data from the data owner. To
            accomplish these data engineering tasks, further development work will be required for this
            project.
        </p>
